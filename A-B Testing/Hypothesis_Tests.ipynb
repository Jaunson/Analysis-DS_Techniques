    "Before we talk about the uses, procedures, or computational methods behind Hypothesis testing I think it is important to address that this topic is mired in some level of misinformation and misconception<sup>[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2009.11889514)</sup>. Misconceptions in this subject appear at many levels within academia even amongst faculty, so it is understandable why this is generally such a hard subject for most folks to wrap their heads around. \n",

    "### What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing refers to a method of statistical ***inference*** in which (*usually*) we compare two statistical data sets. \n",
    "Data alone is often uninteresting, it is the ***interpretation*** of data that is really of value in almost all contexts <sup>[2](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-hypothesis-tests/)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe *Jason Brownlee, PHD* puts it best:\n",
    ">\"In statistics, when we wish to start asking questions about the data and interpret the results, we use statistical methods that provide a confidence or likelihood about the answers. In general, this class of methods is called statistical hypothesis testing, or significance tests.  A hypothesis test calculates some quantity under a given assumption. The result of the test allows us to interpret whether the assumption holds or whether the assumption has been violated.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things hypothesis test methods may be used to evaluate\n",
    "- Does a data sample have a Gaussian distribution? (E.g. Shapiro-Wilk Test)\n",
    "- Do two samples have a linear relationship (E.g. Peason's Correlation Coefficient)\n",
    "- Do two samples have a [monotonic relationship](https://www.statisticshowto.com/monotonic-relationship/). (E.g. Kendall's Rank Correlation)\n",
    "- Are two categorical variables related or independant? (E.g. Chi-Squared Test)\n",
    "- Are the means of two independant samples signficantly different? (E.g. Student's T-Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a non-exhustive list but it is meant to illustrate some of the common questions that are asked as part of a hypothesis test and the method that is used to make that evaluation. It is import to remember that these tests are ***inferential*** and always come with some in-built assumptions, so your interpretation should always account for those assumptions.\n",

    "#### Hypothesis Testing Fomulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test is always formulated so that the assumptions of a given test is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default or **Null Hypothesis** is denoted as *H<sub>0</sub>*\n",
    "\n",
    "While the **Alternative Hypothesis** is denoted as *H<sub>1</sub>*\n",

    "*Example (Student's T-Test)*\n",

    "*H<sub>0</sub>*: The means of the samples are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "*H<sub>1</sub>*: The means of the samples are unequal\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have interpreted the results of the test (which commonly take the form of either a *p-value* or *critical value*) we can than start to make claims and either reject the *H<sub>0</sub>* or fail to reject the *H<sub>0</sub>*.\n"

    "###  Hypothesis Testing Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hypothesis Tests are not mathematical (logical) proofs of one of the two Hypotheses\n",
    "    - Results of a hypothesis test are not deterministic and therefore cannot prove a Null(*H<sub>0</sub>*) or Alternative (*H<sub>1</sub>*) hypothese to be true or false with 100% certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypothesis Tests do not act as a probabilistic proof by contradiction\n",
    "    - Rejecting a Null (*H<sub>0</sub>*) Hypothesis based upon a test is not irrefutable evidence that the Alternative (*H<sub>1</sub>*) Hypothesis is true and vice-versa."
