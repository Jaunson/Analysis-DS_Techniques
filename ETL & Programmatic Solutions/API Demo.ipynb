    "Simply put, an API is a way of utilizing data and or functionality from an application within your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "While API's may differ greatly in terms of the functionality and use-cases they serve, you can largely think of them as a way to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Extract Data from a system or application into your code\n",
    "-  Load Data from code to a system or application\n",
    "-  Bring functionality of an application into you code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly API's are expressed as HTTP endpoints that you can interact with by sending and recieving JSON / XML / HTML payloads. There may be auth layer you have to deal with which typically means embedding some credential / token in your request but that is typically as difficult as it gets when working with an API.\n",
