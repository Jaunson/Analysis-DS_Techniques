# Feature Engineering

Is the process of applying statistical and domain knowledge of your data to build new data points that improve the technical and predictive
performance of ML algorithms.

## What the heck does that mean?

It means that we are trying to take some data we have and build new feature(s) (*vectors* and *columns* are synonyms)  within the data 
to help our application of ML models be more performant and have a greater ability to make accurate predictions.
